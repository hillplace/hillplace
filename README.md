- 👋 Hi, I’m @hillplace

- 👀 I’m interested in this, right now.

- 🌱 I’m currently learning go, python, kotlin, git, github, visual studo code, javascript... and I guess always learning c, c++, java, linux, vm, rdbms(s), php, just everthing, if we are here we just have to be learning everything, even the stuff we know that we know that we forgot. Oh, I guess all that new stuff at the beginning applies to trying to pick up neural networ/ai/machine learning topics and custom server development.

- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on whatever.  I'm no genius so I don't know I'll be of that much use.

- 📫 How to reach me:  well yes, sometimes I check my email.  Text probably is quicker I often look for my phone several times a day... sometimes.
