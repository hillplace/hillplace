- 👋 Hi, I’m @hillplace

- 👀 I’m interested in this, right now.

- 🌱 I’m currently learning go, python, kotlin, git, github, visual studo code, javascript... and I guess always learning c, c++, java, linux, vm, rdbms(s), php, just everthing, if we are here we just have to be learning everything, even the stuff we know that we know that we forgot. Oh, I guess all that new stuff at the beginning applies to trying to pick up neural networ/ai/machine learning topics and custom server development.

- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on whatever.  I'm no genius so I don't know I'll be of that much use.

- 📫 How to reach me:  well yes, sometimes I check my email.  Text probably is quicker I often look for my phone severl times a day... sometimes.  Depends on current level of emotional depression depression seemingly exponentially proportional to the number of compiler errors or sometimes not being able to figure out that one god damn linux command that finishes the fucking install so I can use god damn fucking program I hate my life I hate my life I hate my life. "hello?.... dad... your computer what now?...?!!!..." fuck me there goes my afternoon.
